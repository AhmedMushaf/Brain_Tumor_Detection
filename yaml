## 🏗️ Model Architecture

- Base: `VGG16` (pre-trained on ImageNet, frozen layers)
- Custom head:
  - `GlobalAveragePooling2D`
  - `Dense(256, relu)` → `Dropout(0.5)`
  - `Dense(128, relu)` → `Dropout(0.5)`
  - `Dense(4, softmax)` for classification

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Train the Model (optional)

```bash
python train_model.py
